# Deep Learning on Raspberry Pi 

Welcome to the course 'Deep Learning on Raspberry Pi'. This course is intended to help you learn the basics of deep learning and computer vision, and familiarize with the current deep learning libraries on python, and thus enabling you to implement your own real-time deep learning projects on a small computing platform, Raspberry Pi.

The course is structured into two main phases. The first half of the course introduces you the basic concepts of deep learning and computer vision in a hands-on manner. Every session introduces you to a few concepts in the first hour or so, after which you will learn the implementation aspect with the help of a few examples and exercises. In the second half of the course, you will work on a project of your choice, where you will design and implement a deep learning model to solve a custom problem. You will collect any necessary training data, train the model and test it, all on the Raspberry Pi hardware.

The rough schedule for the first half of the course is as follows.

1. Basics of linear algebra, introduction to python, basics of numpy, basics of symbolic computation. At the end of this lecture, the student should understand basic concepts of machine learning, setup Raspberry Pi, and perform analysis on an example dataset (e.g. Fashion MNIST (https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist))
2. Introduction to linear regression, logistic regression, stochastic gradient descent and its variants. At the end of this lecture, the student should be able to perform binary classification with Keras.
3. Introduction to multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). At the end of this lecture, the student should know the concepts of MLP and ConvNets, the tradeoff between different activation functions, and the implementation of these networks in classifying Fashion MNIST on Raspberry Pi.
